# Font Resources

Place the Squid Game style font file here named as `game_of_squids.ttf`.

You can find similar fonts or create a custom font that matches the Squid Game aesthetic. The font should be:
- Geometric and minimalist
- Similar to the font used in the Squid Game logo and player numbers
- Readable at small sizes on the Pebble display

The font file should be renamed to `game_of_squids.ttf` to match the resource configuration in `package.json`.
